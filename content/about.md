Hi, I am Mahesh.

I am a soon-to-graduate CSE student, originally from North Kanara and currently studying in Bangalore.

Broadly, my interests in computer science revolve around systems, languages and tools.

You can contact me through email, `net [dot] mahesh29 [at] gmail [dot] com`, or through twitter handle `@never_inline`.

## Projects
1. [jnigen](https://github.com/dart-lang/jnigen) - An experimental JNI bindings generator for Dart and Flutter. It's a GSoC 2022 Project.

2. [rrip](https://github.com/mahesh-hegde/rrip) - Bulk image downloader for Reddit. Command line interface with several options.

3. [Avre](https://github.com/mahesh-hegde/Avre) - Experimental beanshell REPL for Android. It runs in process so you can call functions offered by Android frameworks.

4. __Debian on Andriod__ - Not really a project. But some years ago I managed to get a Debian shell on a non-rooted Android 5 device using libfakechroot, libfakeroot and some shell scripts. DNS resolution did not work :D. termux + proot is a better choice if your want this for serious purpose.
