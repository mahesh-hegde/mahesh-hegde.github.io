Hi, I am Mahesh.

I am a soon-to-graduate Computer Science student, originally from rural North Kanara (Uttara Kannada) District.

Broadly, my interests in computer science revolve around systems, languages and tools. For the past one year, my work has revolved around compiler-adjacent topics and developer tools. My languages of choice are usually Go and Java.

When not doing programming related work, I usually watch movies, and listen to songs from those movies. Sometimes I make memes, too.

You can contact me through email, `net [dot] mahesh29 [at] gmail [dot] com`, or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-bhaskar-hegde/). I also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/never_inline) but I rarely check it.

## Projects
1. [jnigen](https://github.com/dart-lang/jnigen) - An experimental JNI bindings generator for Dart and Flutter. It's a GSoC 2022 Project.

2. [rrip](https://github.com/mahesh-hegde/rrip) - Bulk image downloader for Reddit. Command line interface with several options.

3. [Avre](https://github.com/mahesh-hegde/Avre) - Experimental beanshell REPL for Android. It runs in-process so you can call functions offered by Android frameworks.
