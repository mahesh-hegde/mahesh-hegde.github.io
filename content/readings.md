This page includes an infrequently-updated of interesting articles I have read recently and think to be significantly impactful.

### Computer Science & Software Engineering
* [__"Worse is Better"__](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) - An essay which describes how the "perfectly designed" software loses "worse-designed" counterparts. I think every software engineer should read this once.

### Lifestyle, Productivity and Philosophy
* [__"Why do Ivy League students self-sabotage?"__](https://movingthelimit.com/why-do-ivy-league-students-self-sabotage/) - This phenomenon is applicable outside the Ivy leagues, and beautifully explained.
* [__"Deep Work" (Book)__](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Deep_Work_Rules_for_Focused_Success_in_a.html?id=Uc6RzgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) - This book explains how much productive work we lose due to distractions and shallow, fungible work, and also motivates the reader to adapt a lifestyle of deep, uninterrupted work.

### Humour
* [__The Hustle__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U&vl=en) - It's a satire, if you don't get it.
