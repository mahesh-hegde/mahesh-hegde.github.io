This page includes an infrequently-updated of interesting articles I have read recently and think to be significantly impactful.

### Computer Science & Software Engineering
* [__"Worse is Better"__](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) - An essay which describes how the "perfectly designed" software loses "worse-designed" counterparts. I think every software engineer should read this once.

* [__"Use boring technology"__](https://boringtechnology.club/) - A very compelling argument that you should minimize your technology surface and stick to solutions which are well-understood. Even if a tool is not locally optimal for a given use case, it might be still globally optimal choice because it's well-understood.

* [__Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering__](https://boringtechnology.club/) - A talk by Rob Pike on design decisions involved in Go language.

* [__Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster__](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html) - Understanding execution models and operating systems is as important as building distributed systems that scale horizontally.

* [Towards Modern Development of Cloud Applications](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/ghemawat.pdf) - This paper goes back to basics and looks at the ways we can reverse some of the complexity of kubernetes. It's written by the legendary Sanjay Ghemawat.

### Lifestyle, Productivity
* [__"Why do Ivy League students self-sabotage?"__](https://movingthelimit.com/why-do-ivy-league-students-self-sabotage/) - This phenomenon is applicable outside the Ivy leagues, and beautifully explained.
* [__"Deep Work" (Book)__](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Deep_Work_Rules_for_Focused_Success_in_a.html?id=Uc6RzgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) - This book explains how much productive work we lose due to distractions and shallow, fungible work, and also motivates the reader to adapt a lifestyle of deep, uninterrupted work.

### Humour
* [__The Hustle__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U&vl=en) - It's a satire, if you don't get it.
