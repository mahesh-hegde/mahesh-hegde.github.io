However, this project is quite a few years old.1
The name may be quite misleading (much like &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo;) - as distroless images are actually based on Debian (currently Debian 11, Bullseye). However, they don&amp;rsquo;t contain most of the stuff which is there in standard debian image, which such as all the command line executables (coreutils etc..)
What&amp;rsquo;s there in a standard Debian image?</description></item><item><title>Running PostgreSQL locally for back-end development using Docker</title><link>https://mahesh-hegde.github.io/posts/postgres_local_using_docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 11:36:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mahesh-hegde.github.io/posts/postgres_local_using_docker/</guid><description>When doing back-end development or just fiddling with SQL, installing postgres the traditional way may not be very convenient for many reasons. This post describes how to run postgres for local development using docker and docker compose.
One important advantage for me is getting the latest version of postgres, since I tend to use a stable linux distribution.
There&amp;rsquo;s already some amount of documentation for postgresql official docker image. But few things are less than obvious if you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner like me.</description></item></channel></rss>
