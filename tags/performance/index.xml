Mostly OpenMP programs.
First program is to find the value of Pi using Monte carlo methods. We have to then measure the performance with different number of threads, and tabulate it.
Usually, when we add threads using pragma omp parallel for directive, we expect the program to take less time.</description></item></channel></rss>
