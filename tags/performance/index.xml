(Everyone else uses C++). I am not that good anyway in Leetcode, so at least I will learn some more Java by doing this.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the puzzle I was attempting to solve: Given a sorted array and an integer x, find k elements closest to x in the array (Leetcode #658).
The solution is very straightforward: find the lower bound or upper bound of the element in the array using built-in binary search, then expand the range using 2 indexes.</description></item><item><title>OpenMP and rand() function - A small story</title><link>https://mahesh-hegde.github.io/posts/omp_rand_critical_section/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 18:35:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mahesh-hegde.github.io/posts/omp_rand_critical_section/</guid><description>I have a parallel programming subject this semester, and as usual, there&amp;rsquo;s also a lab in which we try and execute small programs (mostly using OpenMP).
First program is to find the value of Pi using Monte carlo methods. We have to then measure the performance with different number of threads, and tabulate it.
Usually, when we add threads using pragma omp parallel for directive, we expect the program to take less time.</description></item></channel></rss>
