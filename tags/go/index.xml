Go is a language made for writing HTTP servers. Since we can represent zip file as a filesystem fs.FS, how hard would it be to write a file server to serve files from it?

Much has been written and said about how the plain text output of command line tools isn&amp;rsquo;t very flexible.

But this also breaks some long-developed intuitions like using grep or other UNIX tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
